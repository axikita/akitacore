DumbdleSign: Oh, right, the other dog is an NPC run by a state machine.
DumbdleSign: Do you want to change their behavior?
-> Nah
	DumbdleSign: Alright, we'll leave them alone.
	
-> Start Walking
	<<set $_DemoGame_DumbdleDogNPC_Rest = false>>
	DumbdleSign: Alright, we'll have them walk around.

->Stop Walking
	<<set $_DemoGame_DumbdleDogNPC_Rest = true>>
	DumbdleSign: Alright, we'll have them stop.

DumbdleSign: Sounds good, let's get started!
DumbdleDog: Alright!
DumbdleSign: First off, text formatting.
DumbdleSign: Any unity markdown is supported.
DumbdleSign: You can do <b>bold,</b> <i>italic,</i> and <i>even <b>nested</b></i> tags.
DumbdleSign: <color=#ff66b2ff>Color tags</color> work fine too.
DumbdleSign: Next up, portraits and expressions. 
DumbdleSign: As you can tell, our respective talk sprites show whenever we talk.
DumbdleDog: I did notice that, yes
DumbdleSign: But also, you can change the expression of the talksprite with an emote, like \:test:
DumbdleDog: Woah! :gasp:
DumbdleSign: Yeah, like that.
DumbdleSign: Now let's do variables. Pick a number.
-> 1
	<<set $_DemoGame_TestInt = 1>>
	DumbdleDog: 1 please
-> 2
	DumbdleDog: 2 please
	<<set $_DemoGame_TestInt = 2>>
-> 3
	DumbdleDog: 3 please
	<<set $_DemoGame_TestInt = 3>>

DumbdleSign: Alright, you just set $_DemoGame_TestInt" to your choice. Now let's see if I can remember it.
<<if $_DemoGame_TestInt == 1>>
	DumbdleSign: ...
	DumbdleSign: Ah, you picked One.
<<elseif $_DemoGame_TestInt == 2>>
	DumbdleSign: ...
	DumbdleSign: Ah, you picked Two.
<<else>>
	DumbdleSign: ...
	DumbdleSign: Ah, you picked Three.
<<endif>>

DumbdleSign: Now let's do commands. You won't see these in the dialogue, but you will in the script, and they should do stuff in game.

DumbdleSign: "Note" doesn't do anything. It's just there for notes.
<<Note: It's true, notes are just here for adding comments.>>

DumbdleSign: "Destroy" will destroy an object. See that red box that I hopefully haven't destroyed yet? fuck that box.
<<Destroy DestructionDemoBox>>

DumbdleSign: "SetActive" will deactivate or activate an object. See that blue box? I'm tired of it.
<<SetActive ActiveDemoBox, false>>

DumbdleSign: But now that it's gone, I find that I miss what we had.
DumbdleSign: Let's bring it back.
<<SetActive ActiveDemoBox, true>>

DumbdleSign: Now for "Cinematic"! Cinematics are a cool way to spice up a scene with a fullscreen splash image.
<<Cinematic DemoCinematicBack, false>>
DumbdleSign: Here's a cinematic behind the dialogue. 
DumbdleDog: So this is a cinematic?
<<Cinematic DemoCinematicFront, true>>
DumbdleSign: (still need some text to pause the dialoge progression for a beat)
<<ClearCinematic>>
DumbdleSign: And, we can go back to normal with "ClearCinematic."

DumbdleSign: What about audio? That's a real thing that exists.
DumbdleSign: Let's get some Sweet Jams going with "Playsong".
<<PlaySong TestPureToneC5>>
DumbdleSign: Anyone who tells you music should have more than one note is just being indecisive.
DumbdleSign: Here's a sound effect, too, with "PlaySound." 
<<PlaySound MewShoot>>
DumbdleDog: !
DumbdleSign:Songs replace each other, multiple sounds can be playing at once.
DumbdleSign: Alright, I'm music'd out. Let's replace that with nothing.
<<PlaySong Null>>

DumbdleDog: Is that everything?
DumbdleSign: Yeah, that's the supported features. Check out the yarnspinner documentation and the akitacore documentation for more details.

Oh yeah, here's a line of narration. If you don't specify a speaker, no icon will appear.
